EMS PCB release 1 errata/corrige

1) The ethernet reference clock generated by the STM32F407 is affected by a long
   term jitter error too large. This problem can be minimized with a software
   patch, but a new PCB release should be planned, with a dedicated oscillator
   driving the ETH_REFCLK signal.

2) The ethernet protection networks R49, DZ1, R52, DZ2 may cause an excessive
   signal distortion and should be eliminated
